# bash-scripting

## Execution
- Create a file using command ===> `vi filename.sh`
- To make the text file executable ===> `chmod 755 filename.sh` 
- To run the script ===> `./filename.sh`
- A tab (to create a space) in between the script like: ```echo "Hello   <tab>   World"``` will show a space as ```Hello  <tab>    World```
- But when there is just space placed, but not tab between `Hello       World`, it will not show any space.
